/* Programming Assignment 2: Exercise C (last modified 10/18/09)
 *
 * In this third and final set of exercises, you will experiment with
 * preemptive scheduling.  We now return to the file mykernel2.c, and study
 * the procedures that were briefly mentioned but not discussed in detail
 * in Exercise B.
 *
 * HandleTimerIntr () is called by the kernel whenever a timer interrupt
 * occurs.  The system has an interval timer that can be set to interrupt
 * after a specified time.  This is done by calling SetTimer.  Notice that
 * the first thing that HandleTimerIntr does is to reset the timer to go off
 * again in the future (otherwise no more timer interrupts would occur).  It
 * then calls DoSched, which causes the kernel to make a scheduling decision
 * at the next opportune time, at which point the kernel will generate a call
 * to SchedProc to select the next process to run, and then switch to that
 * process.
 *
 * MyRequestCPUrate (int pid, int m, int n) is called by the kernel whenever
 * a process identified by pid calls RequestCPUrate (int m, int n), which is
 * a system call that allows a process to request that it should be scheduled
 * to run m out of every n quantums.  For example, if a process wants to run
 * at 50% of the CPU's execution rate, it can call RequestCPUrate (1, 2),
 * asking that it run 1 out of every 2 quantums.  Note that it can call
 * RequestCPUrate (3, 6) to obtain the same 50% of the CPU rate, but giving
 * the scheduler more flexibility in how this rate is achieved.  Thus, the
 * 3 quantums can be allocated in any of 6 consecutive quantums; for example,
 * they may allocated all at the beginning, all at the end, evenly throughout,
 * etc.  When a process calls RequestCPUrate (m, n), the kernel is entered,
 * and the kernel calls your MyRequestCPUrate (pid, m, n), giving you the
 * opportunity to implement how proportional share is to be achieved.
 *
 * MyRequestCPUrate (pid, m, n) should return 0 if successful, and -1 if it
 * fails.  MyRequestCPUrate (pid, m, n) should fail if either m or n are
 * invalid (m < 1, or n < 1, or m > n).  It should also fail if a process
 * calls RequestCPUrate (m, n) such that it would result in over-allocating
 * the CPU.  Over-allocation occurs if the sum of the rates requested by
 * processes exceeds 100%.  If the call fails, it should have no effect, as
 * if it were never called; thus, it should not affect the scheduling of
 * other processes, nor the calling process.  Note that when a process exits,
 * its portion of the CPU is released and is available to other processes.
 * A process may change its allocation by again calling RequestCPUrate (m, n)
 * with different values for m and n.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: If the sum of the requested rates does not equal 100%, then
 * the remaining fraction should be allocated to processes that have not
 * made rate requests (or ones that made only failing rate requests).  This
 * is important, as a process needs some CPU time just to be able to execute
 * to be able to actually call RequestCPUrate (m, n).  A good policy for
 * allocating the unrequested portion is to spread it evenly amongst processes
 * that still have not made (or have only made failed) rate requests.
 *
 * SetTimer (int t) will cause the timer to interrupt after t timer ticks.
 * A timer tick is a system-dependent time interval (and is 10 msecs in the
 * current implementation).  Once the timer is set, it begins counting down.
 * When it reaches 0, a timer interrupt is generated (and the kernel will
 * automatically call HandleTimerIntr).  The timer is then stopped until a
 * call to SetTimer is made.  Thus, to cause a new interrupt to go off in the
 * future, the timer must be reset by calling SetTimer.
 *
 * GetTimer () will return the current value of the timer.
 *
 *
 * Exercises
 *
 * 1. Set the TIMERINTERVAL to 1, and run the program below using the three
 * existing scheduling policies: ARBITRARY, FIFO, and LIFO.  What is the
 * effect on the outputs, and why?
 *
 * 2. Implement the ROUNDROBIN scheduling policy.  This means that each
 * process should get a turn whenever a scheduling decision is made.  For
 * ROUNDROBIN to be effective, the timer interrupt period must be made small
 * enough.  Set the TIMERINTERVAL to 1 (the smallest possible value).  You
 * should then see that the outputs of the processes will be interleaved,
 * as in: 1234123412341234123412341234123412341234 (not necessarily perfectly
 * ordered as shown.  Why?  Hint: Distinguish between a fixed amount of time
 * and the execution of enough instructions to print out a character).
 *
 * 3. Try larger values for TIMERINTERVAL, such as 10 and 100.  What is the
 * effect on the interleaving of the output, and why?
 *
 * 4. Implement the PROPORTIONAL scheduling policy.  This allows processes to
 * call RequestCPUrate (m, n) to receive a fraction of CPU time equal to m/n;
 * specifically, within n consecutive quantums, m should be allocated to that
 * process.  For example, consider the four processes in the program below,
 * where process 1 requests 40% of the CPU by calling RequestCPUrate (4, 10),
 * process 2 requests 30% of the CPU by calling RequestCPUrate (3, 10),
 * process 3 requests 20% of the CPU by calling RequestCPUrate (2, 10), and
 * process 4 requests 10% of the CPU by calling RequestCPUrate (1, 10).  With
 * TIMERINTERVAL set to 1, this should produce an interleaving of the
 * processes' outputs where ratio of characters printed by processes 1, 2, 3,
 * and 4, are 4 to 3 to 2 to 1, respectively.  A sample output is as follows:
 * 121312412312131241231213124123121312412312132423232423343343343444444444
 * NOTE: THIS IS JUST A SAMPLE, YOUR OUTPUT MAY DIFFER FROM THIS!
 *
 * Your solution should work with any number of processes (up to MAXPROCS)
 * that have each called RequestCPUrate (m, n).  You should allow any process
 * to call RequestCPUrate (m, n) multiple times, which would change its share.
 * RequestCPUrate should fail if m < 1, or n < 1, or m > n, or if m/n would
 * cause the overall CPU allocation to exceed 100%.  In that case, the call
 * should have no effect (as if it were never called).  For any process that
 * does not call RequestCPUrate, that process should get any left-over cycles
 * (unless 100% were requested, then it would get none).
 *
 * A good solution will have the following:
 *
 * 1. Over the lifetime of each process, that process will get m/n of the CPU
 * time.  Of course, it is not possible to get EXACTLY m/n, so getting within
 * 10% of m/n is acceptable.
 *
 * 2. Unused CPU time will be equally distributed to any remaining processes
 * that have not requested CPU time.
 *
 * 3. You should avoid the repeated use of floating point operations, which
 * are expensive.  Using approximations for your calculations that only use
 * integer operations would be good.  (However, a working solution that uses
 * floating point operations is better than a non-working solution that avoids
 * them, so first get something working, and then optimize it.)
 *
 *
 * You must turn in your version of mykernel2.c, with all the scheduling
 * policies implemented.  You should set TIMERINTERVAL to 1, which should
 * work with ALL of your policies.
